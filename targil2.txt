1. create List<Integer> with numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6  [hint: Arrays.asList]
   create List<Integer> which has the original list power ^ 2 [hint: use map]
2. Arrays.asList("Reflection","Collection","Stream") -- list of names
   filter and keep only strings starts with "S" [hint: stratsWith]
3. create a random numbers list

4. List<String> myList = Arrays.asList("a1", "a2", "b1", "c2", "c1");
   create a filter and keep only the words starts with c
   map to upper case
   sort
5. print all numbers from 20-30 [hint: IntStream range + foreach]
6. print the average of numbers of range 22-39
7. create a list with numbers 10, 20, 30, 100, 200, -2
    check if any match lower than 10
8. etgar: list of : "z", "123hello", "goodby12", "20"
   sort the list using sorted -- sort by string length
